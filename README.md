# Training and evaluating Machine Learning Models with the UCI dataset of Heart Disease predictors
Second project in the AI in Healthcare course. Built and trained a XGBoost model to predict heart disease from 13 predictors, including age, chest pain, etc. Dataset resampled from the UCI Heart Disease Data Set (n=10,302).

# Classifiers Used
XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes

# Metrics used to evaluate
Confusion matrix, AUC - ROC curve
